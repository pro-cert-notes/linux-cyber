# Governance, Risk, & Compliance
This course covers key pre-engagement steps for penetration testers, including scoping, regulations like PCI DSS and GDPR, frameworks and rules of engagement. It also examines target selection, assessment and agreement types, shared responsibility, and legal and ethical requirements for CompTIA PenTest+ (PT0-003) exam prep.
## Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
PCI DSS sets a baseline security standard for organisations that store, process, or transmit payment card data. The PCI Security Standards Council, founded in 2006 by major card brands, maintains the standard to reduce fraud and breaches.
#### Key requirements
PCI DSS requires organisations to:
- secure networks and systems, including firewalls and removal of vendor default passwords
- protect stored cardholder data and minimise retention
- encrypt cardholder data in transit and not send unprotected PAN via end-user messaging such as email, SMS, chat, or instant messaging
- patch and harden systems, deploy anti-malware controls, and build secure applications
- restrict access with least privilege, physical safeguards, unique user IDs, and multi-factor authentication where required
- monitor activity, keep logs, test controls regularly, and train staff under an information security policy

Organisations must document testing and remediation, manage risk, and respond to incidents in line with legal and contractual duties.

Non-compliance can lead to monthly fines, forensic investigations, higher fees, and loss of card acceptance.
